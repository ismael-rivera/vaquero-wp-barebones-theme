	Vaquero is a bare-bones WordPress theme
	implementing a wrangler work chain for
	for easy prototyping and master cloning any
	theme into a mobile ready deployment app.
  
	Stemming from a fork off of starkers theme.
	I basically created it so I would not have 
	to do the same things I usually do to any 
	project or theme destined for app or website.

	I created this theme as a bootstrap for
	my online work as a webdeveloper but 
	with all the changes I normally do to 
	starkers right at the beginning. One of 
	those things is a sass based wrapper system 
	that makes it easy for creating site-wide 
	divs that are liquid flexible and with very 
	little code ensure compatibility for web 
	apps and mobile deployment. Nothing epic but 
	useful and time-saving if you're into clean 
	liquid grids.
